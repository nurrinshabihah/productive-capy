                Mood and energy changes are correlated with changes in blood sugar levels. 
                Regular eating helps to keep blood sugar levels stable. You may become exhausted, 
                agitated, anxious, and unable to concentrate if you don't eat regularly. Include eating 
                breakfast, eating every three to four hours, avoiding eating junk food, consuming a variety 
                of fruit and vegetables, and drinking plenty of water.

                Your mood can be improved by endorphins, which are released during physical activity.
                When you're feeling down, you could almost subconsciously avoid doing the activities 
                that make you feel better. Even though it may not feel appealing at first, making sure you 
                get some exercise might help you feel better right away.

                Some people enjoy reading to broaden their worldview or to immerse themselves in fantasy 
                settings. Some people like to express their emotions through art, while others prefer to 
                discuss issues with others. Whatever your preference, make sure you express yourself since 
                it will keep you connected and help you learn more about who you and who you want to be.

                Let yourself to step away from a problem when you get sucked into it and go do something entirely 
                different. It could appear easier to handle when you come back to it later. When you are feeling 
                stuck and want to quit overthinking a situation, distracting yourself is not a bad idea. Instead, 
                it can be a good strategy.

                How would you react if a friend approached you for support, advice, or simply to have a conversation? 
                A lot of us would be happy to be chosen as someone to confide in because it can make us feel important. 
                When you're nervous or depressed, it's easy to think poorly of yourself and less likely to ask for help 
                from others. Try to overcome this emotion by talking to trusted people. You could be delighted by how much 
                better you feel and how warmly they've reacted to you, just as you would if the roles were reversed.

                Individuals often unwind or take a break from their daily stresses in a variety of ways. When you start to 
                feel down or pressured, you may stop doing these activities as you forget to be kind to yourself. Whatever it 
                is, consider the activities that make you feel more content or calmer, and make sure they are still a part of 
                your routine. These activities can include taking a hot bath, watching a movie, listening to music, or participating 
                in social activities.
